        <p>me tweaking because he has spoiled my mulching plans.</p>
        <p>if you stumble upon a post on Instagram or Tik Tok with this hashtag you're in for a dose of the mulch gang for Life meme this meme features cute puppy pictures alongside a playful AI voice talking about how much these pups crave mulch they often playfully call themselves soil pilled</p>
        <p>let's talk about what this word a mulch actually means mulch is like a protective layer you put on top of soil people use it for a bunch of reasons to save water make the soil healthier keep annoying weeds away and make things look nice usually mulch is made from organic stuff like leaves and wood chips</p>
        <p>so here's the fun part folks are comparing dogs to this layer of soil covering specifically they're talking about how little dogs enjoy messing around in the garden especially at the top layer of soil I am a soil pilled mulch posting lonee hearted dirt Angel currently mulch maxing and eating wood chips preparing myself for compost girl Autumn at the beginning folks were sharing images of animals along with some text but later on video memes started popping up in August smell shared a real that had an AI voice chiming in and at the end of the video it proudly declared mulch gang for life</p>
        <p>if I eat soap I don't do it because I did no I didn't mulch gang for life so the Instagram users smell and klag kept on sharing these mulch gang memes for the next few weeks they started getting shared over on Tik Tok 2 that's when the meme really took off and began catching people's eyes day by day and guess who's really into it dog owners this meme is Making Waves especially among the puploving crowd good morning to my fellow siblings of the RO today I had a mous spa day hi it's meme culture</p>
